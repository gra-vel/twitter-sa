# Text Mining using Twitter

This project is an exploratory data analysis using R. The dataset comes from Twitter and it was retrieved using Twitter API. Tweets are from the timeline of four media outlets and the goal is to identify the differences and similarities between these timelines. The libraries used for this project are:
- `rtweet`
- `tidyverse`
- `tidytext`
- `stopwords`
- `scales`
- `lubridate`
- `corrplot`

Most of the analysis follows the structure from the first chapter _Text mining with R_ by Julia Silge & David Robinson.
